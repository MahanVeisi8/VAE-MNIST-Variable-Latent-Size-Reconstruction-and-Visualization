# VAE-MNIST-Variable-Latent-Size-Reconstruction-and-Visualization
A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) project on MNIST with variable latent sizes. Focuses on reconstructing digits from compressed representations and visualizing the latent space. Includes experiments with different latent dimensions and performance metrics for reconstruction quality.
